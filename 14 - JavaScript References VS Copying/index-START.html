    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); 
    age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(players, team); // will return players[3] as Lux as well.    
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // or use the Array.from() method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'reboorrrnnn';
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    // or you can use the highly awaited object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = {...wes};
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes); // will reveal that wes.socail.twitter = @coolman so even though dev is a copy of an object its a shallow copy and doesn't apply to the arrays and objects inside wes.

    // there is a function called deepClone that can be looked up online that will clone every level.

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // poor man's deepClone;
